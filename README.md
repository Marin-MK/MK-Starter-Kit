<h1>MK Starter Kit</h1>

The aim of the MK Starter Kit is to provide a fast, free, cross-platform and open-source alternative to RPG Maker XP and Pokémon Essentials, while still using Ruby. It will have an editor similar to RPG Maker but customized entirely with Pokémon in mind.

Our main goal is currently to replicate Fire Red and Leaf Green in terms of visuals and mechanics. Once that's done, we can add newer features onto the base.

We use a slightly modified version of <b><a href="https://github.com/Marin-MK/mkxp">mkxp</a></b>, originally made by <b><a href="https://github.com/Ancurio">Ancurio</a></b>.


<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<list>
<li><b>Windows</b>: This is the most recently compiled version, and uses Ruby 2.5.6. <b>mkxp.exe</b> is always the most up-to-date, and will have features or changes in the executable files first.
<li><b>Linux</b>: We've also compiled Linux ourselves already, and it uses Ruby 2.6.0 (to be downgraded to 2.5.6). <b>mkxp.amd64</b> will be updated to be identical to the Windows executable once that executable is done and stable.
<li><b>MacOS</b>: We have not compiled mkxp on macOS yet, and therefore uses Ruby 2.1.0. The latest macOS binary can be found in <b><a href="https://github.com/Ancurio/mkxp">mkxp's repository</a></b>.
